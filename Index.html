            <b>Albert Einstein</b>was a German-born theoretical physicist.Best known for developing the theory of 
            relativity, he also made important contributions to the theory of quantum mechanics,and was thus a 
            central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern 
            physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.His massâ€“energy equivalence formula
             E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".
             His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.He received the 1921 Nobel Prize 
             in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the 
             photoelectric effect",a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.Einsteinium, one of the 
             synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.
